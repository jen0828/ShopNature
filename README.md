## Reflection

 * This is an ongoing personal project. I created an e-commerce app for my friend who loves making organic cosmetics, and she would love to have her brand one day.

* I decided to use React library to upskill myself with React.

* New technologies: I tried to use new technologies as much as possible, and this is the first time I have used Redux and Cypress.

* Redux: I used Redux so all `components` can access `state` without using `props`. It took a while to set this up and understand new concepts such as `reducer` function and `dispatch()` method. I wouldnâ€™t say it greatly benefited my project given its size. However, Redux would be very useful tool when working on a large-scale project with many components.

* Cypress: I have tried several testing frameworks for JS and Ruby, and I find front-end testing more challenging than back-end testing. However, Iâ€™m glad I tried Cypress, as testing the front-end app with Cypress was fun.

* Next: 

  - [x] My next task is to look into deploying this app with JSON-server.
